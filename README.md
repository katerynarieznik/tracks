# Track Recs

Front-End School 3.0 // Case // An app for managing music tracks

## Setup Instructions

Pre-requisites: NodeJS version `v20.13.1` or higher

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Additional Information

Preset values in the `src/lib/constants.ts` file:

```javascript
export const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000/api";
export const TRACKS_PER_PAGE = 12;
export const DEBOUNCE_TIMEOUT = 500;
```

### Extra Tasks

Implemented optimistic updates for track creation, editing, and deletion of both track and audio.
There might be some edge cases, but I am running out of time.
